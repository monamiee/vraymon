                            I have a passion for the programming world, especially in Game Development. For me Create games is a challenging thing. I love to learn new things, and I am a diligent and hardworking person. If there is something new that I don't know or understand, I will study it until I understand it. I'm also a perfectionist person, if I'm doing a project, I will make sure everything I'm doing on that project is perfect before submitting it. I'm able to work in a team, and I have good communication skills.

                            I have been using this Unity Game Engine for about 2 years. Usually, I use Unity for my personal projects for training and learning. My knowledge about Unity Game Engine is quite a lot, but I still want to learn and deepen this Unity Game Engine.

                            As a programmer, I certainly have to master several programming languages. Some of the programming languages ​​that I have learned and understood include C #, C ++, Java, Html, Css, Python, SQL. I have also used several of these programming languages ​​for projects that I am working on.

                            Object-Oriented Programming is one of the paradigms that I am good at the most. Because most of the projects I work on are Game Development, OOP is the most important and crucial one, so I'm good at the OOP concept.

The feature that makes this application interesting is the AR (Augmented Reality) feature which can bring up real animal models when directed at a marker. This application is a package with its Interactivity Book.

But unfortunately, this game has not been able to attract the attention of the jury. In this game, I contributed to Environmental Design, Mechanic Game, Implementation (Coding), and Level Design. Meanwhile, my colleague contributes to UI / UX.

                            The website you are exploring is the result of my work. I developed my portfolio website myself. I built everything from scratch without the help of the library (Boostrap, Laravel, etc). Css and Html on this website I developed myself from scratch. I made image assets on this website myself by taking a free and copyright-free icon or image and then edited it using Photoshop.
